# 👋 Hi, I'm xshotss (or shots)

I'm a **hobbyist developer** who loves all things retro—especially old-school tech, emulation, and creative coding projects. Most of the time, I make fun things or tinker with ideas that I find interesting, rather than building for utility alone. For me, programming is about curiosity, nostalgia, and the joy of bringing quirky ideas to life.
